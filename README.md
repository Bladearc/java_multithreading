Java Multithreading Examples

This repository contains a collection of Java multithreading examples designed to help developers understand and master multithreading concepts. The examples are organized into three categories:





Easy: Basic concepts such as thread creation, sleep, join, and simple synchronization.



Medium: Intermediate topics like thread pools, locks, and more advanced synchronization techniques.



Hard: Advanced scenarios involving concurrency utilities, deadlock avoidance, and performance optimization.

Each example is a standalone Java file with comments explaining the code and the concepts being demonstrated.

Key Concepts

The examples in this repository cover the following multithreading concepts:





Thread Creation: Using Thread and Runnable to initiate threads.



Thread Lifecycle: Understanding thread states and transitions.



Synchronization: Implementing synchronized methods and blocks for thread safety.



Inter-thread Communication: Utilizing wait(), notify(), and notifyAll() for coordination.



Concurrency Utilities: Leveraging ExecutorService, CountDownLatch, Semaphore, and more.



Thread Pools: Managing worker threads efficiently.



Locking Mechanisms: Applying ReentrantLock and other locks for fine-grained control.



Atomic Variables: Ensuring thread-safe operations without locks.



Deadlocks and Livelocks: Recognizing and preventing these issues.



Thread Safety: Best practices for safe concurrent programming.



Performance: Optimizing multithreading for better efficiency.
